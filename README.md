This platform will be the first portfolio of my journey to start my career as a **Data Analyst**. ðŸ˜„

Having **2 years of experience in economic research as a Research Assistant**, I've been teaching myself how to operate Excel, R, and Python, and I will never stop learning something new and deepening my analytical skills every day!
